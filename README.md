# A Claude Code Utility For Crafting Personalized Deliverables For Business Owners

This repo is a way for me (Costa Michailidis, Founder at Innovation Bound) to work with Claude Code to create personalized deliverables for my prospective and current customers.

# Deliverables

Here is a list of the deliverables we create for each client:

0. A Company & Business Owner Overview Markdown File

This is not a deliverable, but we build this first to help us make our deliverables.

It has:

- Business Name
- Business Owner Name
- Business Website
    // Claude Code to list other key information here...

1. Brand Guidelines

The brand guidlines are a single page website that describe and actually follow the brand guidlines of the company.

We derive them from browsing (using curl) and screenshoting using puppeteer (with a timeout if needed) the client's website. It's important to track down the actual SEO meta tags, the CSS colors, the Fonts and file files to download and use for the brand guidelines.
